<h2 id="dont-you-get-lonely">Don&#39;t You Get Lonely?</h2>
<p>As anyone who&#39;s commuted to work on a crowded New York City subway
can tell you, it is perfectly common to feel lonely even when you&#39;re
surrounded by people.</p>
<img src="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2017/07/01/subway-part-two/assets/images/Norman_30209384A_Subway058-640.jpg">

<p>One of the biggest benefits of remote work is the ability to choose
who you spend your days with. Many employees don&#39;t have much choice
over who their coworkers are, and in a traditional office setting,
the only way to change your coworkers is to get a new job.</p>
<p>On the other hand, changing your office space is much easier. For
a while I spent most days working from my dining room table -
getting some time to myself was great. Then I felt like I missed
office happy hours and social events, so I got a small
office at the local WeWork.</p>
<p>Through working at the WeWork, I met a lot of great people that
have helped push me to be better. Before moving to Florida, I lived
in New York and the Bay Area, two places that are not
known for having a strong fitness culture. On the other hand, through
going to a coworking space I&#39;ve made friends with a former bodybuilder
and a former record-breaking college wide receiver. Being surrounded
by impossibly fit people makes it that much harder to skip leg day.</p>
<p>Remember - remote doesn&#39;t necessarily mean you&#39;re sitting in your
basement wearing a bathrobe from 9 to 5. It means you have the freedom
to choose where you work. You can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up an office in your house</li>
<li>Work from a coffee shop</li>
<li>Join a coworking space</li>
<li>Join a social club</li>
<li>Go to the local library</li>
<li>Get space at your local coding bootcamp</li>
<li>Go to the park</li>
</ul>
<p>The point is that you can choose your work environment, and switch
as your needs change. Major crunch time at work? Find a quiet corner
of your house where you won&#39;t be distracted. Things are a little
slow and you&#39;re feeling cooped up? Go to a coffee shop or social club.
Is New York City winter getting you down? Move to Florida! The choice
is yours, and you can switch regularly without losing your job.</p>
<h2 id="but-what-about-collaborative-work-and-communication">But What About Collaborative Work and Communication?</h2>
<p>Maybe this is an unpopular opinion, but unless you&#39;re in sales, most
productive work is done alone. Unfortunately, there&#39;s no such thing
as a collective brain. Individuals need to put in the thought and
effort to produce work on their own, whether the work is building an app,
writing a white paper, balancing the books, or building a financial model.
Even <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/effective-navigation-in-pair-programming">pair programming is typically broken up into two roles</a> with distinct responsibilities.</p>
<p><a href="/10-lessons-from-10-years-as-a-software-engineer.html">Communicating, and sometimes overcommunicating, is key</a>, don&#39;t get me
wrong. To work well remotely, you need to be a good writer to get
your point across in Slack, and a clear and concise speaker to get
your point across in Zoom. Regular meetings are key to ensuring that
everyone&#39;s work lines up and each team member has an understanding
of what the rest of the team is working on.</p>
<p>However, striking the right balance between communicating your work
and doing your work is key. And, as a remote worker,
you have the privilege and responsibility of finding the right
balance for yourself. In an office environment, it is hard to
say no to a meeting invitation or when someone taps you on the
shoulder to ask you something.</p>
<p>When you work remotely, you have
more leeway to batch your communications. <a href="https://tim.blog/2007/03/22/how-to-check-e-mail-twice-a-day-or-once-every-10-days/">Check Slack and email
only twice a day like Tim Ferriss</a>? As
a remote worker, it is possible. But the responsibility for
finding the right balance is yours.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-stay-motivated">How Do You Stay Motivated?</h2>
<p>There is some truth to the old adage that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jim-rohn-youre-the-average-of-the-five-people-you-spend-the-most-time-with-2012-7">you are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with</a>. Going into an office <em>can</em> help you be a more productive employee. If you&#39;re spend every day with top-notch hard working people, you&#39;ll be more motivated and pick up good habits. Surrounding yourself with people that are successful in a part of your life that you want to improve is one of the oldest self-improvement tricks in the book.</p>
<p>On the other hand, remote work gives you more freedom in choosing
which 5 people you&#39;re the average of. Suppose you just became a
father, and you want to spend more time with people that have kids
because you want to be a better parent. If all your coworkers are
single 20-somethings, you&#39;re severely limited in the amount of time
you can spend with fellow parents.</p>
<p>Working remotely doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re spending every
day hanging out with unmotivated beach bums. Many people at my
coworking space run their own successful businesses. There are
plenty of remote employees as well, in industries ranging from
visa application consulting to tech VCs, and they all work as
hard, if not harder, than office employees.</p>
<h2 id="moving-on">Moving On</h2>
<p>I had my concerns about remote work before trying it. Being lonely,
struggling with communication, and lacking motivation are real concerns.
As is the fact that remote jobs are still uncommon. However, I feel
the benefits outweigh the risks. Being able to choose which work
environment is best for you given your current situation is unbelievably
valuable for your personal development. If you have the opportunity
to work remotely, give it a shot - you&#39;ll be surprised how much
your life will improve when you have more control over your day-to-day.</p>
